# Optimizing Revision

## Tracking your progress&#x20;

The best way to revise these questions is to take notes of each question. You can go from something as simple as a quick Excel sheet tracking each question and tricks used or you can be more thorough like using Notion to track every question.

### My method

For me, I use a Notion database to track every question, breaking down my understanding into the following components:

1. **Intuition:** how the optimal solution can be understood by the layman
2. **Optimizations/Notes:** additional notes/tricks to optimize the solution
3. **Alternatives:** potential alternative solutions that are present; usually I refer to the solutions section of LeetCode to get a sensing of the available alternatives
4. **Remarks:** any remarks to future you as you are referring back to this list

## Revision strategy

When revising questions, you should prioritize the problems you wanted to redo or the ones that you "tapped out" or gave up without solving the problem first. Additionally, if the original solution was very intuitive for you, you can also try solving the problem using one of the alternatives to expand your repertoire of techniques.

Refer to the [faqs.md](faqs.md "mention") for more information about common questions I had when starting out.
