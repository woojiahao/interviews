# 🍕 Welcome!

> Internship hunting and interview preparation takes a lot of practice and a whole lot of luck. While it is easy to feel discouraged when you receive rejection after rejection, it is keep your head high regardless and to continue pushing onward.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
I have posted a blog post about the "meta-process" of preparing for technical interviews that you can find here: [https://blog.woojiahao.com/post/technical-interview-systems/](https://blog.woojiahao.com/post/technical-interview-systems/)
{% endhint %}

## Who am I?

My name is Jia Hao. I am a computer science undergraduate from the National University of Singapore.&#x20;

Before May 2023, I was a technical interviewing newbie. Although I had years of experience developing software, I was barely able to solve easy problems. This is because interviewing requires a completely different set of skills. While I was very fortunate to have still landed an internship for summer 2023, I realized that my interviewing skills were lacking and that spurred me to start taking interview preparation seriously.

I devised methods of studying, combining hundreds of resources to develop a strong foundation in many aspects of technical interviews. Thankfully, my effort paid off and I was able to land internship offers from companies like Citadel, Google, and Palantir.

I am creating this guide to consolidate my learning and to share this learning with others. I hope that this guide can help accompany you on your own technical interviewing journey and that you are able to land the internship/job of your dreams.

## Using this guide

{% hint style="info" %}
I will not be covering fundamental concepts like how arrays work as those are assumed knowledge
{% endhint %}

I recommend tackling each topic one at a time and focusing on understanding the concepts behind each question you solve. You can find the list of questions and study plan under [study-plan.md](getting-started/study-plan.md "mention").&#x20;

Once you have felt like you have mastered the fundamentals, feel free to move on to working on problem lists like [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) and [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75).

This guide is not all powerful and you will not become a technical interview expert in two weeks. It is important that you start your preparations early. I have included my timeline for securing my internships for summer 2024: [summer-2024-timeline.md](getting-started/summer-2024-timeline.md "mention").

## Acknowledgements

The basis of this guide is inspired by the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/) written by [Yangshun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yangshun/?originalSubdomain=sg). I started my journey using that guide and have combined it with many other resources to create this guide. I highly recommend giving it a read as it covers many aspects of interviewing that I did not cover.
