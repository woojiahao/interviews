# 🍕 Getting Started

> Interviewing is a skill that takes practice and time. It helps to be able to spot the recurring patterns and how to best tackle them. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive look at the various topics and patterns of interview and prepare you for other aspects of interviewing like system design and behavioral.

## About Me

My name is Jia Hao. I am a computer science undergraduate student from the National University of Singapore. Before May 2023, I had not touched LeetCode much before (I could barely handle Easy problems), even though I had years of experience developing software.&#x20;

During an internship in the summer of 2023, I started seriously practicing LeetCode and various interview components like system design and behavioral. This intensive preparation helped me to secure two internships: one at a HFT and the other at a big tech company.

Nowadays, I solve LeetCode to keep my mind sharp and to have fun!

## Using this Guide

This guide aims to give you the starting fundamentals of solving the commonly seen coding interview questions along with some of my insights for the other components of interviewing.

I recommend tackling each topic one at a time and focusing on understanding the concepts behind each question you solve, rather than trying to shoot for solving a high number of problems with low understanding. Once you have felt like you have mastered the fundamentals, feel free to move on to trying a diverse set of problems from lists like [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) and [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75).

Additionally, I recommend starting your preparations really early. I have included my timeline for securing my internships for summer 2024 below.

## Summer 2024 Timeline

1. Start of May 2024: sourcing for problems and figuring out my weaknesses when it comes to interviewing
2. May 2024 to mid June 2024: working on my fundamentals by completing questions by topic
3. Mid June 2024 to July 2024: working on other problems to expand my exposure and speed
4. July 2024 to October 2024: start applying for roles in Singapore, US, and UK
5. October 2024 to November 2024: started interviewing and received my offers

## Preface

Internship hunting + interviewing takes a lot of practice and a whole lot of luck. I was ghosted/rejected by 99% of the 200 companies I had applied to. While it is easy to feel discouraged when you see these numbers, I think it's even more important to notice that while luck is a factor, you should be minimizing your potential for failure by working on the things you can control such as your ability to solve problems under pressure.
