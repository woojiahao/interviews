# üè´ Interview School

Interviewing is a skill that takes practice and time. I usually try to give about 3 months lead time to prepare for my interviews.&#x20;

My timeline for summer 2024 can be found below:

1. May - June 2023: revise DSA concepts
2. June - July 2023: start working on Grind75 + Neetcode.io roadmap
3. July - October 2023: applying to internships

You can find my curated list of practice questions [here.](miscellaneous/revision-questions.md)
