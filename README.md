# üçï Welcome!

Internship hunting + interviewing takes a lot of practice and a whole lot of luck. I was ghosted/rejected by 99% of the 200 companies I had applied to. While it is easy to feel discouraged when you see these numbers, I think it's even more important to notice that while luck is a factor, you should be minimizing your potential for failure by working on the things you can control such as your ability to solve problems under pressure.

Interviewing is a skill that takes practice and time. It helps to be able to spot the recurring patterns and how to best tackle them. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive look at the various topics and patterns of interview and prepare you for other aspects of interviewing like system design and behavioral.

## About me

My name is Jia Hao. I am a computer science undergraduate from the National University of Singapore. Before May 2023, I had not touched LeetCode much before, even though I had years of experience developing software. I could barely handle easy problems and that was an issue.

During an internship in the summer of 2023, I started seriously practicing LeetCode and various interview components like system design and behavioral. This intensive preparation helped me to secure two internships: one at a HFT and the other at a big tech company.

Nowadays, I solve LeetCode to keep my mind sharp and to have fun! I started this guide to help formalize my own learning and also help make this knowledge more accessible to others.

## Using this guide

{% hint style="info" %}
I will not be covering fundamental concepts like how arrays work as those are assumed knowledge. Instead, I will focus on the techniques you can apply when approach such problems
{% endhint %}

This guide aims to give you the starting fundamentals of solving the commonly seen coding interview questions along with some of my insights for the other components of interviewing.

I recommend tackling each topic one at a time and focusing on understanding the concepts behind each question you solve, rather than trying to shoot for solving a high number of problems with low understanding. You can find the list of questions and study plan under [study-plan.md](getting-started/study-plan.md "mention"). Once you have felt like you have mastered the fundamentals, feel free to move on to trying a diverse set of problems from lists like [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) and [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75).

Additionally, I recommend starting your preparations really early. I have included my timeline for securing my internships for summer 2024 found here: [summer-2024-timeline.md](getting-started/summer-2024-timeline.md "mention")
