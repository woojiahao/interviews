# Warmup

The problems under this warmup are as such:

1. [climbing-stairs.md](climbing-stairs.md "mention")
2. [nth-tribonacci-number.md](nth-tribonacci-number.md "mention")
3. [perfect-squares.md](perfect-squares.md "mention")

These are just basic problems to ease you into the idea of DP, the further questions are not as easy and will take some time to get used to. Do NOT worry about that and just focus on learning as much as you can.
