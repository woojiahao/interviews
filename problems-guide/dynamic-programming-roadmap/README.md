# Dynamic Programming Roadmap

{% hint style="info" %}
From here on out, I will be referring to Dynamic Programming as DP instead
{% endhint %}

To find the list of problems in this roadmap, refer to [#dynamic-programming-roadmap](../../getting-started/study-plan.md#dynamic-programming-roadmap "mention")&#x20;

The core patterns for dynamic programming can be found under [dynamic-programming.md](../../algorithms/dynamic-programming.md "mention")
