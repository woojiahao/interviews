# Operating Systems

{% hint style="info" %}
Much like [sql.md](system-design/sql.md "mention"), there is too much things to cover when talking about operating systems and most importantly, concurrency patterns. I have attached my notes from the operating systems module in NUS ([CS2106](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS2106/introduction-to-operating-systems)) for you to self-study

Some of the other commonly asked questions include things like:

1. What is a deadlock?
2. What is a race condition?
3. What is the difference between deadlocks and race conditions?
4. How do you detect a deadlock?
5. How do you solve a deadlock?
6. What is paging?
7. What is a page fault?
8. Where are logs stored on a Linux system?
9. How do you deal with thread explosion?
