# FAQs

## When should I "tap out"?

This ties in to the next question but generally, I "tap out" when I have spent more than an hour to two hours on a problem and still have no idea about the intuition or question type to solve the problem. If I have some intuition but am struggling to implement it, I may "tap out" after about 30 minutes of attempting but to no avail.

I also think there shouldn't be any fear of tapping out when you have spent a lot of time on the problem already. You should be maximizing your learning over banging your head against a wall. You can always return to these problems after you have practiced more and to see if your understanding holds.

## How long should I spend on each question?

Generally, I try to spend:

* **Easy:** 20 minutes
* **Medium:** 40 minutes
* **Hard:** 1-2 hours

However, do note that this is after having gone through so much practice with these questions. If you are still new to LeetCode, please feel free to take more time for each question difficulty. There are some problems that are also easier than its grading so do not get complacent if you solve them quickly.

## Should I spam questions if I am short on time?

Absolutely NOT. Quality > quantity every time. In an ideal scenario, you should not be "cram studying" and should have followed a similar timeline as I did. If you are not able to do so and are rushing for time, then I would recommend focusing on completing **at least the first two weeks** of the revision questions along with **Graph and Tree questions.**

You do not need to do every question, just pick the questions that you are able to comfortably solve within the time you have. Focus on understanding every question and its solution before moving on as that is far more important. Knowing how to solve 100 questions means nothing if all you did was memorize the code.

## How many questions should I be doing everyday?

This depends entirely on your own skills and abilities. As mentioned above, you should focus on quality over quantity. There were topics that took me 40 minutes total to solve all of the questions while others took me two days to complete. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses and you should not pressure yourself to complete everything in one sitting.

Ideally, you should be able to complete at least five questions a day (given dedicated practice and time) but I would generally aim to solve **at least three** as a good starting pace. As you get better, the focus should be on appreciating the intuition behind each question, as opposed to finishing as many questions as possible.

## Should I just stick to doing LeetCode dailies to get good?

A controversial opinion I hold is that LeetCode dailies are pointless if you're trying to seriously study for technical interviews. The reason is that these problems, while topical, do not focus on exposing you to the patterns that most interviews will have. They are fun problems to solve but they do not give you targeted practice. So, I would recommend prioritizing the study plan over random questions, at least until you are confident in your foundations or have the time to attempt LeetCode dailies.

## What language should I be using?

I personally use **Python** for all my interviews and OAs, but you should use the language you are most comfortable with. Languages like Java and C++ have very extensive built-in library support for data structures like heaps and tree sets.

The focus should really to be as comfortable as possible in your chosen language and focus on understanding the tricks that your language has to save time and improve your code quality.

## Do I need LeetCode Premium?

Not at all, most of the problems within the [study-plan.md](study-plan.md "mention") are free and those that require a premium account can be found on other websites like LintCode instead. The only perk LeetCode premium gives you is that it provides the companies that ask each question which can be useful if you're targeting specific companies but there are open-source lists of that information circulating online as well.
