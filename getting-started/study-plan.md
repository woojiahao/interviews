# Study Plan

{% hint style="info" %}
These questions were compiled from the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/) across its various topics. The order of studying and study plan is also inspired by the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/#week-1---4-topical-study--practice).
{% endhint %}

## Preface

It took me about **a month** to complete the study plan (not including the dynamic programming roadmap). It's important to preface that I had completed a data structures & algorithms (DSA) course right before starting my revision so a lot of the fundamentals was fresh in my head. You may find yourself spending more/less time than I did and that is alright.

If you are not familiar with fundamental DSA, it is recommended that you read a book on DSA before diving into LeetCode as it will help you better understand how to apply the data structures/algorithms to the problems. You can find my recommendations in the [faqs.md](faqs.md "mention").

## How to use?

Feel free to refer to the associated sections about each topic (in the left sidebar) to learn the techniques and patterns commonly associated to questions in that topic.

While it is good if you are "discover" these patterns yourself, having them formally introduced can help you to structure your thinking going into each problem.

### Notation

* :star: : requires LeetCode premium
* :triangular\_flag\_on\_post: : problems that I found incredibly tricky and often tapped out

### Duplicate questions

My recommended approach for duplicate questions is to try the question again but using the associated topic to solve it, rather than glossing over them again.

## Week 5 onwards

Once you have completed the study plan, feel free to use other question banks like Grind75 and Neetcode to continue improving your familiarity and speed.&#x20;

You will notice that many of the questions from this study plan overlaps with these question banks. I recommend leaving them to the end and redoing them when you've completed the other questions.

You may also want to try improving your dynamic programming skills with the dynamic programming roadmap below.
