# Study Plan

{% hint style="info" %}
These questions were compiled from the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/) across its various topics. The order of studying and study plan is also inspired by the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/#week-1---4-topical-study--practice).
{% endhint %}

These questions are arranged by the order of topics that is recommended to be completed. For me, I spent about **a month** completing the entire list of questions. There are four groups of questions so you can aim to complete each group in a week.

However, that is my personal estimation, your mileage may vary as you may not have share the same experiences/strengths/weaknesses as me. So take your time to solve each problem and ensure that you fully understand them before proceeding.

{% hint style="info" %}
Questions marked with :star:are those that require LeetCode premium to access.\
\
Questions marked with :triangular\_flag\_on\_post:are problems that I found incredibly tricky and often tapped out, these are questions I would focus more time on when revising.
{% endhint %}

You may also notice that there are duplicate questions across topics. My recommended approach for these questions is to try the question again but using the associated topic to solve it, rather than glossing over them again.

One last piece of advice I have when attempting these problems is to first read the associated sections I have included in this guide and then trying the techniques out. While you can try "discovering" the patterns yourself, having a guided format will help you structure your thinking going into each problem.

## Week 5 onwards

Once you have completed the study plan, feel free to use other question banks like Grind75 and Neetcode to continue improving your familiarity and speed. You will notice that many of the questions from this study plan overlaps with these question banks. It is recommended that you leave them last and only redo them when you've completed the other questions
