# Summer 2024 Timeline

My biggest success factor is having started the process early.&#x20;

Being able to submit your applications early, and receive and solve online assessments quickly are crucial in increasing your success rate as that means you are in more companies' pipelines.

{% hint style="info" %}
I understand that some of you may not receive your offers as early as I did. Do not be discouraged and continue pushing forward, you will eventually receive good news!
{% endhint %}

This was my timeline for my summer 2024 internship hunt:

* **Start of May 2023:** sourcing for problems and figuring out my weaknesses when it comes to interviewing
* **May 2023 to mid June 2023:** working on my fundamentals by completing questions by topic
* **Mid Jun 2023 to Jul 2023:** working on other problems to expand my exposure and speed
* **Jul 2023 to Oct 2023:** start applying for roles in Singapore, US, and UK
* **Aug 2023 to Nov 2023:** started interviewing and received my offers
