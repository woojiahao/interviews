# Summer 2024 Timeline

I would attribute the biggest success factor to be the time where I started the process. Being able to submit your applications early and solve the online assessments quickly are crucial in increasing your success rate.

* Start of May 2024: sourcing for problems and figuring out my weaknesses when it comes to interviewing
* May 2024 to mid June 2024: working on my fundamentals by completing questions by topic
* Mid June 2024 to July 2024: working on other problems to expand my exposure and speed
* July 2024 to October 2024: start applying for roles in Singapore, US, and UK
* October 2024 to November 2024: started interviewing and received my offers
