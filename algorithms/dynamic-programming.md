# Dynamic Programming

## Recognizing DP problems

1. Minimizing/maximizing:&#x20;
2. Number of ways:
3.

## Steps to solving DP

1. Identify states
2. Identify state transitions
3. Implement top-down
4. Convert to bottom-up

## Types of DP

1. Linear sequence
2. Grid
3. Two sequences

## Common recurrence relations

## Recursive to iterative

## Optimizing space
